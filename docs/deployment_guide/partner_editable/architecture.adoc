image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/cloud-one-conformity-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* An administrator enrolls a new or existing AWS account in AWS Control Tower, generating a lifecycle event.
* The lifecycle event uses an Amazon Eventbridge rule to invoke an AWS Lambda function.
* The Lambda function creates an AWS Identity Access Management (IAM) cross-account role in the newly created AWS account.
* The Lambda function queries AWS Secrets Manager for the API key secrets that are used to authenticate with the {partner-product-short-name} endpoint.
* The Lambda function registers the new AWS account with the {partner-product-short-name} endpoint.
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Ensure that the additional components are shown in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.
