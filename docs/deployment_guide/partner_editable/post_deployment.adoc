After the AWS CloudFormation stack completes successfully, return to the {partner-product-short-name} console. Confirm that your accounts are imported and that the {partner-product-short-name} bot has started scanning your AWS accounts to alert you about any misconfigurations or posture concerns.

As a best practice for scanning your AWS accounts, prioritize high-severity findings for investigation and remediation. 

Also keep the {partner-product-short-name} role up-to-date. The {partner-product-short-name} bot is continuously improved to enhance visibility or add coverage for new AWS services. Sometimes, a new IAM permission is required for the role in each protected account. To update the role, modify the CloudFormation stack using the template URL provided in the link:#_deployment_steps[Deployment steps] section. The role is updated to the most recent version in all current and future enrolled accounts.

=== Cleanup

To remove the AWS Control Tower lifecycle hook, identify and delete the CloudFormation stack. Managed accounts that have already been added remain protected. Refer to the {partner-product-short-name} documentation for details about removing an account subscription.

If you want to remove protection for all managed accounts, send a `remove_all` invocation event to the lifecycle hook before deleting the CloudFormation stack. Follow these steps:

. Log in to the AWS Management Console for your organization's AWS Control Tower management account.
. Open the CloudFormation console.
. Locate the *ConformityLifeCycleHook* stack, and open the *Resources* tab.
. On the *LifecycleEventHandler* row, locate the *Type* value *AWS::Lambda::Function*. Choose the link to open the AWS Lambda console for the function.
. In the Lambda function console, open the *Test* tab and create a new event with the following event payload:
+
....
{"InvokeAction":"remove_all"}
....
+
. Choose *Invoke* to trigger the lifecycle hook with the `remove_all` event payload.

Verify that the removal has been triggered for each account in your organization by reviewing the output logs.â€ƒ

== Self-host the Partner Solution content

If you want to ensure that the code you review is the code that you deploy, you can self-host the Partner Solution content. Follow these steps:

. Create an S3 bucket in the Region where AWS Control Tower is deployed. The bucket can belong to any AWS account, as long as your AWS Control Tower management account can access the content.
+
WARNING: If your bucket is not in the same Region where AWS Control Tower is deployed, the stack deployment will fail.
+
. Copy the CloudFormation template into your bucket using the `quickstart-ct-trend-micro-cloud-one-conformity/templates/Trend-Micro-Cloud-One-Conformity-Lifecycle-QS.yaml` key.
. Copy the Lambda function deployment package into your bucket. You can choose your own prefix, but the object path must end in `functions/packages/c1c-controltower-lifecycle.zip` (example: `quickstart-ct-trend-micro-cloud-one-conformity/functions/packages/c1c-controltower-lifecycle.zip`). 
+
[TIP]
====
Use the AWS command-line interface to copy the content:
....
aws s3 cp --recursive \
    s3://aws-quickstart-us-east-1/quickstart-ct-trend-micro-cloud-one-conformity \
    s3://<your-bucket>/quickstart-ct-trend-micro-cloud-one-conformity
....
In this example, the S3 key prefix value is the default `quickstart-ct-trend-micro-cloud-one-conformity/` value.
====
+
. Review the content according to your organization's preferred practices. You can read the details of the CloudFormation stack to see what it creates and the properties of each resource. You can also learn about the Lambda function by reading its source code.
. Using the URL to the template, launch the CloudFormation stack in the same Region where AWS Control Tower is deployed. Replace the default parameter value for the S3 bucket name with the name of your bucket. Also replace the S3 key prefix with the name of the prefix in the bucket where the content is stored. 

WARNING: If you deploy the stack in a different Region than AWS Control Tower, the lifecycle function will not receive events when new accounts are created or removed and will not automatically add or remove accounts in {partner-product-short-name}.

== Best practices for using {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
// Provide post-deployment best practices for using the technology on AWS, including considerations such as migrating data, backups, ensuring high performance, high availability, etc. Link to software documentation for detailed information.

Follow these best practices:

* Configure SAML to manage access to your {partner-product-short-name} account. For more information, refer to the https://cloudconformity.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HELP/pages/134086850/Set+up+SAML+SSO+integration+for+Cloud+Conformity[{partner-product-short-name} documentation^].
* Configure notifications to security teams for high severity violations through integrations like PagerDuty or Amazon SNS. For more information, refer to the https://cloudconformity.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HELP/pages/58982475/Communication+Channels[{partner-product-short-name} documentation^].
* Distribute responsibility for account remediation and visibility to account owners by configuring integrations with tools like Zendesk and ServiceNow for operations teams, or Jira and Slack for development teams.
* Configure custom profiles to tailor monitoring for your security policy or individual accounts. Engage account owners to determine if specific frameworks like Service Organization Control 2 (SOC 2) or PCI should be included in evaluation. For more information, refer to the https://cloudconformity.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HELP/pages/142278677/Profiles[{partner-product-short-name} documentation^].
