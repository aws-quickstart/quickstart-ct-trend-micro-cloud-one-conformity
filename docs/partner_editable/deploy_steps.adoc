. In the {partner-product-short-name} portal, continue to create your account. Choose the Region in which to host your data. Most organizations choose the Region closest to the majority of their workloads. Some other organizations may have compliance requirements that affect their Region choice.

. In the {partner-product-short-name} console, choose the arrow next to your name in the top-right corner. Then choose *User settings > API Keys"* from the left navigation and create a new API key. Be sure to save this string, as it cannot be retrieved later. This key is used to authenticate the automation from the AWS Control Tower management account to the {partner-product-short-name} API. For more information about generating an API key, see the https://cloudconformity.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HELP/pages/77463659/Public+API+-+API+Keys[{partner-product-short-name} documentation^].
